# Predicting-critical-Temperature-Tc-of-super-conductor
 Introduction


A superconductor is a substance that conducts electricity without resistance when it becomes colder than a critical temperature. The intention of this Notebook is do an Expolatory Data Analysis on the given data and:

.)Find the factors the affects Tc.

.)Visualizing the given data in 2D in space using PCA.

.)Develope and compare Various models for predicting Tc.
